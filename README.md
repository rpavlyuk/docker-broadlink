# docker-broadlink â€” Docker container to run BroadLink IoT toolset
[BroadLink](http://www.ibroadlink.com) is very popular solution for making your home smart. They offer Wi-Fi switches, sensors, remote controls and some other quite interesting devices. You can find more about BroadLink on their official WEB-page: http://www.ibroadlink.com

BroadLink's vendor provides mobile phone application called [e-Control](https://itunes.apple.com/app/broadlink-e-control/id793152994?mt=8) to manage the devices. However, what BroadLink doesn't provide is the official SDK and/or API and that creates a problem if you want to integrate your BroadLink devices into your "smart home" system along with the other IoT devices you already have.

Luckly, we have Python library created by **Matthew Garrett** aka @mjg59: https://github.com/mjg59/python-broadlink. What I did in scope of this project is that I've put this library inside Docker container and added some other useful stuff that you would probably like.

## What is inside the Docker image?
* Fork of ```python-broadlink``` library by user @eschava (to have ```get_energy()``` available)
* ```python-broadlink``` installed as Python library
* Pre-configured [Zabbix Agent](https://www.zabbix.com/zabbix_agent) to allow monitoring of certain parameters

## Running broadlink docker image
Please, make sure you have [Docker](http://docker.io) installed and configured before you continue with any further steps.
### Run using systemdock (recommended)
[SystemDock](https://github.com/rpavlyuk/systemdock) is the tool to run Docker containers as ```systemd``` service.
* Install systemdock by following the instructions from https://github.com/rpavlyuk/systemdock
* Within the project root, change directory to where the systemdock profile is:
```
cd systemdock-broadlink/
```
* If you're using RedHat-based OS and installed ```systemdock``` using RPM installer (see above) then:
```
sudo make install-rpm clean
```
* Otherwise, use classic method:
```
sudo make install clean
```
* Check configuration file ```/etc/systemdock/containers.d/broadlink/config.yml```. Make sure that TCP ports 10555 and 8888 are not in-use by any existing processes on the host system.
One more thing in file ```/etc/systemdock/containers.d/broadlink/config.yml``` is changing Zabbix Server IP and hostname (in case you're using it). Change ```192.168.1.5``` and ```liberty.home.pavlyuk.lviv.ua``` provided as a sample to something relevant to your configuration. 

* Enable the service on system boot:
```
sudo systemctl enable systemdock-broadlink
```
* Start the service:
```
sudo systemctl start systemdock-broadlink
```
* You can monitor service log by calling ```journalctl``` (hit CRTL+C to abort):
```
journalctl -u systemdock-broadlink -f
```

### Plain run of the container
* You can run the container as any other Docker container:
```
docker run -it --name broadlink -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro -p 8888:8888 -p 10555:10555 --net host docker.io/rpavlyuk/c7-broadlink
```
> **NOTE:** You have to run container with ```network_mode``` set to ```host```. Otherwise, it won't be able to communicate with BroadLink devices using multicast UDP packages.
* If you plan to use it with Zabbix Server, then run the following commands to configure the agent (replace ```ZABBIX_SERVER_IP``` and ```ZABBIX_SERVER_HOSTNAME``` with your own values):
```
docker exec broadlink perl -pi -e "s/\=127.0.0.1/\=ZABBIX_SERVER_IP/gi" /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf
docker exec broadlink perl -pi -e "s/\=zabbix.server/\=ZABBIX_SERVER_HOSTNAME/gi" /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf
docker exec broadlink systemctl restart zabbix-agent
```

## Using BroadLink toolset
### Using python-broadlink
Once you have the container installed, you can try using it to test any programming samples like described by @mjg59
* First, enter the container's shell:
```
docker exec -it broadlink bash
```
* Try communicating and controlling your BroadLink devices using the library:
```

### Using with Zabbix
[to be added]

## TO-DO
* Embedd [broadlink-http-rest](https://github.com/radinsky/broadlink-http-rest) project into the container (That's why I've reserved port 8888 for ;))

## Credits
* First of all, to @mjg59 for creating the libraty
* @eschava for adding SP3S device support
* And me :) [Roman Pavlyuk](mailto:roman.pavlyuk@gmail.com) aka @rpavlyuk http://roman.pavlyuk.lviv.ua/
